# Guides

## Real Content

Here is a collection of guides with no particular connection to any other. At least, nothing intentional. There is nothing particularly unique about *my guides* compared to say, any of the thousands of others on the internet. I find it good practice to document my experiences in a way that could also be helpful to others. So, if you're here, and eager to learn about something, click a topic to view the guide!

**bold text**

*italic text*

This sentence has both **bold** and *italic* text in it. This sentence has a single ***bold italic*** text entry.

This sentence has an asterisk * in it, but never has a closing mark. Until now ... * there is a closing mark.

> This is a blockquote that contains **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, and regular text! How much text is needed to break into a new line? I suppose that really varies as it will be greatly affected by the window size. Is this enough text to break on the current viewable window size? What about text that spans multiple lines? We need this to push the SVG icon into an uncomfortable position to make sure it stays at the top of the element vs centering.
