# Guides

Here is a collection of guides with no particular connection to any other. At least, nothing intentional. There is nothing particularly unique about *my guides* compared to say, any of the thousands of others on the internet. I find it good practice to document my experiences in a way that could also be helpful to others. So, if you're here, and eager to learn about something, click a topic to view the guide!

I like humor (dad jokes incoming!), so keep a light heart while reading.

## Second Heading

I needed a second `h2` style heading for the TOC parser.

## Third Heading

How many headings do I need to get the bookmark anchor references working?

## More than this

Surely, it'll be more than this?!

### If not, try more

Wee hoo!
