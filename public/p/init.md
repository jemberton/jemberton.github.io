# Welcome

This is the first post on the site! Wahoo! I am slowly building the underlying engine that drives everything, but also trying to add content as I go. I'll fill in as many gaps as I can along the way, but I have very limited free time.

Since the goal of the site is to showcase all my projects, share knowledge, and just generally be helpful, there may be numerous edits to what is already here. You may need to refresh the page and clear your cache to load changes. At least, for a little while. I haven't worked on the cache helper yet and most browsers strictly prohibit a site accessing your local cache (... and for good reason!)

Feel free to send an email if there is something wrong with the site or the content. If you would like to see a different topic covered, I'd like to hear about that too!
