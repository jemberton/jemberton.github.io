# woohoo

this is a markdown file to be used as the blog content. I liked the idea of the metadata in JSON format, but that lacks an easy editing mode like Markdown.

Let's take a second and create a full markdown example ...

# heading 1

## heading 2

### heading 3

#### heading 4

##### heading 5

###### heading 6

**bold text**

*italic text*

This sentence has both **bold** and *italic* text in it. This sentence has a single ***bold italic*** text entry.

This sentence has an asterisk * in it, but never has a closing mark. Until now ... * there is a closing mark.

> This is a blockquote

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2
3. Ordered List Item 3

- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2
- Unordered List Item 3

`inline code block`

This is a plaintext codeblock
