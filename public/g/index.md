# Guides

Here is a collection of guides with no particular connection to any other. At least, nothing intentional. There is nothing particularly unique about *my guides* compared to say, any of the thousands of others on the internet. I find it good practice to document my experiences in a way that could also be helpful to others. So, if you're here, and eager to learn about something, click a topic to view the guide!

I like humor (dad jokes incoming!), so keep a light heart while reading.
